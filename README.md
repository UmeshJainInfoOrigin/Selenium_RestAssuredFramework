# Selenium_RestAssuredFramework (UI/API Automation Framework)

It's a framework created with Cucumber, TestNG, Gherkins and Maven for dealing with UI Automation using Selenium & API Automation using REST Assured.



## List of Functionality in Framework for Selenium

Selenium is a popular tool for automating web browser interactions and testing web applications.

#### 1. Web Browser/Application Automation: 
* Automating web browsers/applications to perform tasks like opening web pages, filling out forms, moving cursor via robot class, clicking buttons and many more.

#### 2. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
* Running tests on multiple web browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Edge to ensure compatibility.

#### 3. Headless Browsing:
* Running browser automation in a headless mode (without a graphical user interface) for faster and more efficient testing.

#### 4. Element Locators:
* Locating web elements using various strategies, including by ID, name, class, XPath, CSS selectors, etc.

#### 5. User Interactions:
* Simulating user interactions such as clicking, typing, hovering, and scrolling.

#### 6. Handling Alerts and Pop-ups:
* Dealing with JavaScript alerts, pop-up windows, and authentication dialogs.

#### 7. Data-Driven Testing:
* Running test cases with different sets of data to validate application behavior under various conditions.

#### 8. Test Suites:
* Grouping test cases into suites and executing them in a specified order using tags.

#### 9. Parallel Test Execution:
* Running tests concurrently on multiple browsers or devices for faster test execution.

#### 10. Synchronization:
* Implementing wait mechanisms to ensure that elements are loaded before interacting with them, preventing flakiness in tests.

#### 11. Page Object Model (POM):
* Structuring test automation code using the POM design pattern for maintainability and reusability.

#### 12. Assertions and Verifications:
* Validating expected results by using assertions to check elements, text, or attributes on a web page.

#### 13. Data-Driven Frameworks:
* Developing data-driven testing frameworks to separate test data from test logic.

#### 14. Test Reporting:
* Generating test reports with detailed information on test results, including pass/fail status.

#### 15. Test Configuration:
* Managing test configurations and settings, including browser settings and test environment parameters.

#### 16. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration:
* Integrating Selenium tests into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.



## List of Functionality in Framework for REST Assured

REST Assured is a popular Java library for automating and testing RESTful web services. 

#### 1. HTTP Request Methods:
* Sending HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.

#### 2. Request Payloads:
* Sending request payloads, including JSON, XML, form data, or other content types.

#### 3. Request Headers:
* Adding custom headers to HTTP requests, including authentication, content type, and custom headers.

#### 4. URL Parameters:
* Including query parameters and path parameters in requests.

#### 5. Authentication:
* Handling authentication mechanisms like Basic Authentication, OAuth, API keys, and tokens.

#### 6. Response Validation:
* Validating HTTP response status codes, response headers, and response body content.

#### 7. JSON Path and XML Path:
* Extracting data from JSON and XML responses using specific path expressions.

#### 8. Assertions:
* Implementing various assertions to check response data, response time, and other aspects of the API response.

#### 9. Response Serialization and Deserialization:
* Converting API responses to Java objects (deserialization) and Java objects to request payloads (serialization).

#### 10. Response Body Content:
* Validating the content of the response body, including schema validation, content matching, and data extraction.

#### 11. Chaining Requests:
* Chaining multiple API requests together based on the response of the previous request.

#### 12. Logging and Reporting:
* Generating logs and reports of API test execution.

#### 13. Test Configuration and Setup:
* Configuring global settings, such as base URLs, authentication tokens, and other common parameters.

#### 14. Data-Driven Testing:
* Running tests with multiple sets of data to validate different scenarios.

#### 15. Parameterization:
* Using variables and placeholders in requests to make them dynamic and reusable.

#### 16. Response Time Measurement:
* Measuring and asserting response times to check API performance.

#### 17. Error Handling:
* Handling errors and exceptions, including expected and unexpected errors.

#### 18. Mock Server Integration:
* Creating and running mock servers to simulate API responses for testing.

#### 19. Request and Response Logging:
* Logging request and response details for debugging and troubleshooting.

#### 20. Parallel Test Execution:
* Running tests in parallel for faster test execution.

#### 21. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration:
* Integrating REST Assured tests into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

#### 22. Parameterized Tests:
* Running the same test with different input data to ensure API behavior consistency.

#### 23. Dynamic Environments:
* Managing different test environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with environment-specific configurations.

#### 24. Pre- and Post-Processing:
* Executing pre-processing and post-processing steps before and after each test.

#### 25. Code Reusability:
* Creating reusable utility functions and classes to reduce code duplication.

#### 26. Test Data Management:
* Managing and handling test data, including generation, retrieval, and cleanup.
